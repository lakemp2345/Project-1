## Goal
This project searches for popular music trends in the last 5 years. 

## Data Sources

We took the Billboard Hot 100 charts from the first week of 2016 up until the present week (2021-06-19), and looked at Spotify's audio features attributed to each song. 

### Spotify Audio Features

1. Danceability - describes how suitable a track is for dancing
2. Energy - is a measure of intensity and activity 
3. Instrumentalness - predicts whether a track contains no vocals
4. Liveness - detects the presence of an audience
5. Valence - a measure describing the mood
6. Acousticness - lack of electrical amplification
7. Tempo - beats per minute (bpm)
9. Duration - length of song

## Findings

We found that the most popular song from the last 5 years is Blinding Lights by The Weeknd, and the artist with the most songs in the charts is Drake.

We also found that the duration of songs decreased significantly.

The audio features showed an interesting spike or slump in December compared to the rest of the year.

# Summary of Conclusions

There is no significant correlation between audio features.  
The duration of songs has gradually decreased in the past five years.  
Drake and Blinding Lights are the most popular artist and song over the past 5 years.  
SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) may influence music characteristics in December?
