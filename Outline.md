# Introduction 
For this project, the Data Demolishers foucsed their time looking at Billboard Top 100 data and Spotify data over the past 5 years (2016 - 2020). At the inception of our work, the objective was not entirely clear, however, we set out to identify any trends and/or patterns for the Spotify songs/artists in the Billboard Top 100 chart. Ultimately, we wanted to analyze these findings, graph them in easy to read charts, and potentially compare them to global events, seasons, innovation, etc.
